# v2-VR-Architectural-Design
This project was meant to create buildings in virtual reality to give real-estate and architects a  glipse of what they are building and its size. By leveraging Virtual Reality (VR), we provide users with the tools to lay out and design basic building structures, offering a unique glimpse into the spatial dynamics and scale of their projects before any physical groundwork begins. 

Ensure you have a compatible VR headset and install our application on your device.
